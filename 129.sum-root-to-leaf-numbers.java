 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
 *
 * Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path
 * could represent a number.
 * 
 * An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number
 * 123.
 * 
 * Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
 * 
 * Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3]
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   3
 * Output: 25
 * Explanation:
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
 * Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
 * ⁠   4
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 9   0
 * / \
 * 5   1
 * Output: 1026
 * Explanation:
 * The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
 * The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
 * The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
 * Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
